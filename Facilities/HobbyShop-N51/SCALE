We don't know the size of the PDF drawing, so the scale annotations in
Floor Plan.pdf are not helpful.

On 2023-06-19 I measured the short, leftmostm, exterior wall to be
sc29.6 feet.

This corresponds to a deltaY of about 696 in floor_plan.html if
cleaned_up.svg is generated with a scale_factor of 1.0.

This suggests a scale factor of 23.5 global SVG coordinate units per
foot of real world distance.
