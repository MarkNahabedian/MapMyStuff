# None of these parameters are right yet:

# We don't need -scale_relocation or -drawing_scale_box because the N51
# drawing has no scale indicator.

# We Don't need -clip_svg_viewbox because the N51 drawing just has the
# Hobby Shop, not other parts of the floor.  We presumably also don't
# need -increase_viewbox_height.

# I don't think we need -clip or -clip_box.

# I don't think we need -hide_classes, at least the N51 drawing has no
# "style4" styles.  Styles could easily have been re-numbered though.
# In any case, I don't see any extraneous markings in the SVG from
# Inkscape.
