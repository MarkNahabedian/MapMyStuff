# MapMyStuff

The goal of this project is to provide documentation for a shared
space (like the MIT Hobby Shop), in particular a floor plan and
locator.

It could be applied to other facilities if an SVG floor plan is
available.

Inkscape can be used to convert a PDF floor plan to SVG.  A pythn
script is provided to clean up the Inkscape SVG output.


See the map of the
[old MIT Hobby Shop](https://MarkNahabedian.github.io/MapMyStuff/Facilities/HobbyShop-DuPont/floor_plan.html)
